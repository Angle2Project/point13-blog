		<h2>Most of the service businesses focus only on revenue and profit. Unfortunately, nobody has a magic wand to make those go up — that’s why it’s important to focus on other KPIs first.</h2>
		<p></p>		
		<p>The hardest thing to achieve in any service-based business is predictability. Trust me, as a person who leads the business side of a technology and design agency, I know the pain of it. Predictability allows us to plan better and smarter, and it allows us to focus and more easily steer the business in the direction we want. However, focusing only on revenue and profit is wrong. By using some software and tools you can predict what you are going to do in the following period, but that’s just not enough. It is also easier to start with some other areas and KPIs that will eventually influence revenue and profit.</p>

		<p></p>
		<h3>What Metrics Should You Focus on Then?</h3>
		<p></p>
		<p>Doing some research online I came to the conclusion that more than 90% of service-based businesses track only revenue and profit. However, the rest 10% that track other KPIs have proven to have much more successful businesses with higher revenue growth and <a href="">double-digit profit</a>. Basically, the list of the most important KPIs for any service-based business is:</p>
		<p></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Revenue</li>
			<li>Profit</li>
			<li>Cost</li>
			<li>Revenue and Profitability per Client</li>
			<li>Revenue and Profitability per Employee</li>
			<li>Client Satisfaction</li>
		</ul>
